                    <p>Flapkart is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was founded by Sameer Bansal and Nidhi Bansal in 1950. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.
       The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2017, Flapkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. Flapkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.In late 2011, Flapkart made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com and the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak. In February 2012, the company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013. In May 2012, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer. In May 2014, Flapkart acquired Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for ?20 billion (US$280 million). Myntra continues to operate alongside Flapkart as a standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while Flapkart itself focuses on the mainstream market and major international brands.  </p>

                    <h4 style="color:blue">1988&#45;</h4>
                    <p>In May 1988, Flapkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer. In May 2014, Flapkart acquired Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for ?20 billion (US$280 million). Myntra continues to operate alongside Flapkart as a standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while Flapkart itself focuses on the mainstream market and major international brands. In February 2014, Flapkart partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone. Motorola also partnered with Flapkart on the Moto E—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:blue">2002&#45;</h4>
                    <p> Flapkart subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds), the Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late-2014 (which saw similarly accelerated sellouts), and Micromax's Yu Yunique 2 in 2017.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:blue">2016&#45;</h4>
                    <p>On 6 October 2016, in honour of the company's anniversary and the Diwali season, Flapkart held a major sale across the service that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over technical issues the site experienced during the event, as well as stock shortages. In March 2015, Flapkart blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's mobile app instead. The following month, Myntra went further and discontinued its website on all platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that Flapkart itself would perform a similar move, but this did not occur. </p>
